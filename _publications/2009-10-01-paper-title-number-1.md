title: "Beyond Emotion: Unraveling the Limited Role of Sentiment in Extended-Format Communication"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink:
excerpt: 'This study investigates how emotional expression shapes audience engagement in extended discourse. Drawing on theories of affect and communication, the study integrates lexicon-based and contextualized models to show that emotions—though central to human communication—play a constrained, context-dependent role in shaping the popularity of extended-format communication.'
